# HomesAutomation
This is a automation framework using Page Object Model, Selenium Webdriver, TestNg, and Log4j.


To use the application, open the project in Eclipse IDE or any java editor 

========= Assuming user is in the main project directory (com.homes) =========
                        
                        1) left-click on testng.xml
                        2) Navigate to 'Run As' 
                        3) Click on testNG suite


The Framework attempts to navigate to home page and search the key words, Miami, Los Angeles, and Seattle.
With each search, the webdriver will navigate to the 6th listing of property. In the future it will run in parallel.
